This is still a mess.
Rather than use a git fork, I've opted to just patch a given copy of eprover.
The 'original' should contain the unmodified files from your eprover dir.
The 'modified' files will replace them.
Aside from the new code added, the mods are mostly minor, and it is easy to find the place where they should go.

Since I can't run Trail on my laptop, I use trail10.
Example:

on trail10:
bash teprover/make.sh

on my laptop:
getp.sh 10 # if protocol 10

getp.sh
  copies the exec back to my laptop so it can be checked in
  copies to over to CCC

The getp.sh script has all my paths hard-wired into it.
That's good enough for now.
